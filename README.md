With the expansion of online study resources, it is much more likely that students today will spend hours on end browsing multiple websites to gather data. Thus it is essential that the students are able to maintain a record from all the sites that they have referred to during their reference. 

Xohoj aims to help users in this by allowing users to take notes from all their online resources; be it a video on a platform like udemy or youtube  or an article on byjus; through an easy interface. Xohoj consists of a web-based dashboard and a handy browser extension. 

The browser extension allows the user to take notes, either by selecting text, adding screen grabs and time stamped video links or even typing from various sources. The user can thus easily bookmark resources and maintain records of the resources that they have referred to for a topic in a single platform. The extension will also allow the user to track the progress on various open courses for which the user receives certifications. 

The user can also use the dashboard for various utility purposes. The user can arrange their notes into more organised, readable formats using the dashboard. They can also review the resources that they have used for taking notes. They can track their progress on curated topics. The user can create a two way sync for their notes to other platforms such as Notion or Obsidian which are widely used for note making, or simply export to an easily accessible pdf. 

Thus a Computer science student will be able to take notes from various tutorials they refer to online, for instance a video lecture series on NodeJS. They can add important points and screengrabs with the respective timestamps to the note for reference, in order to avoid having to go over the entire lecture again. An UPSC aspirant on the other hand can make use of the platform to keep track of the various references they might have used for future reference. Through note taking across multiple sites, they can track the various possibly conflicting statements across multiple resources.

Thus the platform will consist of various tools and functions that will help focus the browsing habits of students. Taking notes across multiple platforms, the students will be able to easily cross refer to multiple resources and make the best use of their time and effort.
